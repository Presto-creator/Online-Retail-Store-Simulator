# Online-Retail-Store-Simulator
My final CS1 Project, dubbed "Online Retail Store Simulator" does just what the name implies. It's a simple store simulator using command prompt as its interface

Thanks for checking out this project! I spent at least 30 hours on it, figuring everything out and it should work almost perfectly (with a few exceptions, of course.)
One of them being the fact that this project does not run outside of visual studio. It's probably some memory management stuff that I didn't know back then, 
but since this is an old project it doesn't really matter much. 
Also, typing letters into the input breaks it because I never added that catch. 
Those are the two biggest issues I know about, but I'm pretty sure they're the only two.
